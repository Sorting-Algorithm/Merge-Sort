# Merge-Sort
Merge sort is a “divide and conquer” algorithm wherein we first divide the problem into subproblems. When the solutions for the subproblems are ready, we combine them together to get the final solution to the problem. This is one of the algorithms which can be easily implemented using recursion as we deal with the subproblems rather than the main problem.
